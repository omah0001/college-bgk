Its spectacular buildings and sprawling campuses (Old and New) present an impressive glimpse of a veritable university. With its primary, secondary and higher educational institutions the sangha has&nbsp; become&nbsp; avertual boon and blessing of lord Basaveshwar for the students of this religion.
